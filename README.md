## Name
I used a random generator. :)

## Why?
In OpenStack Ansible world, we have a *ton* of repositories that we need to
apply changes in bulk to.  This provides us with an API to be able to iterate
on all of those in order to make those bulk changes.

## Usage
Check out the `drop-sphinxmark.py` file for inspiration, it probably will
contain everything you need.  You can use `pipenv` to run it by doing
something like this: `pipenv run python drop-sphinxmark.py`

## Contributions
They're welcome. :-)
